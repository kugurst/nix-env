# NIX-env #

## What is this?

A collection of stuff I use across all my NIX platforms (ArchLinux, Cygwin, Mac, and anything inbetween). Scripts and configurations abound.

## How would I use this?

Symlink stuff in here to wherever they would normally go. E.g.:

```bash
$ ln -s emacs/.emacs ~/
```

## What stuff is in here?

Check out the `README.md`s in the subdirectories, if they're there. Of course, you can always just crack open the files.
